IMPORTANT NOTES (in case a Backend Service API Integration is required in the question):

    1. The backend endpoint host url is mentioned in app/src/main/res/raw/config.properties. The property name is "api_url". An example is mentioned in "MainActivity.kt".
    2. PLEASE USE THIS PROPERTY ("api_url") WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO CALL A BACKEND API. ALSO DON'T CHANGE THIS PROPERTY ELSE THE APP WILL NOT BUILD PROPERLY AND YOUR SUBMISSION WILL NOT BE SCORED.
